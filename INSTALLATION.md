Allow Installation from Unknown Sources
==========

By default, Android prevents users from downloading and installing applications from locations other than Google Play. 
To allow installation from non-marketplace sources, a user must enable the *Unknown sources*  setting on a device 
before attempting to install an application. The setting for this may be found under *Settings > Security*
